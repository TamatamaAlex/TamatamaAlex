## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Alex

I am a current cloud engineer in my first year.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on serverless deployments in AWS. Hoping to one day work as a game backend server architect or security architect in the future. 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Terraform, and some Bash.
âš¡ Fun fact: I love Tanuki and games.
